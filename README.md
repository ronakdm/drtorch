# Diropt

Diropt is a library for distributionally robust optimization in PyTorch.

## Installation
Diropt requires PyTorch >= 1.6.0. Please go [here](https://pytorch.org/) for instructions 
on how to install PyTorch based on your platform and hardware.

Once Pytoch is installed you can install diropt by running in command line from the
root folder

```pip install -e .```

Additional dependencies to run the example in `examples/train_fashion_mnist.ipynb` can be installed using `pip install -e .[examples]`. To build the docs, additional dependencies can be run using `pip install -e .[docs]`.

## Quickstart

A quickstart example is present in the docs `docs/source/quicstart.ipynb`.
